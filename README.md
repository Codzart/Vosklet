# Overview
- **STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**
- A speech recognizer built on Vosk that can be run on the browser, inspired by [vosk-browser](https://github.com/ccoreilly/vosk-browser), but built from scratch and no code taken!
- Designed with strong exception safety
- See the *usage* folder's README.md for API documentation, notes.
- See the *devel* folder for the newest build (not guaranteed to work) and the JS build script

# Additions to vosk-browser:
- Download multiple models
- Model storage path management (for multiple models)
- Model ID management (for model updates)
- Massively smaller JS size (>5.7MB vs 1.7MB)
- All related files (worker.js, worklet processors,...) are bundled
- Shorter from-scratch build time


# Basic usage
- Use the prebuilt binary through JsDelivr.
