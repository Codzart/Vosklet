# Overview
- A speech recognizer built on Vosk that can be run on the browser, inspired by [vosk-browser](https://github.com/ccoreilly/vosk-browser), but built from scratch and no code taken!
- Designed with strong exception safety
- See the usage folder's README.md for API documentation and important notes
- See the devel folder for the newest build (not guaranteed to work) and the JS build script

# Additions to vosk-browser:
- Download multiple models
- Model storage path management (for multiple models)
- Model ID management (for model updates)
- Smaller JS size (>5.7MB vs 3.9MB)
- All files are merged into a single bundle.
